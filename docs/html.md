# HTML documentation

The `html_docs` Meson feature builds a versioned static documentation tree for
libpkgstate-apply. The tree is generated from the repository's authoritative
Markdown, canonical Markdown manual sources, public headers, legal
notices, and Doxygen configuration.

Generation is atomic. The checker rejects missing inventory entries, broken or
escaping local links, leaked source/build paths, and source-format links. The
installed tree is placed below:

```
share/htmldocs/libpkgstate-apply/3.1.2
```

HTML output is derived. Edit the Markdown, headers, or Doxygen source
and regenerate; never patch generated HTML.
