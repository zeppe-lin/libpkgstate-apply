# NAME

libpkgstate-apply - admit completed native application as installed state

# SYNOPSIS

**#include <libpkgstate-apply/state_projection.h>**

**#include <libpkgstate-apply/adapter.h>**

# DESCRIPTION

**project_completed_application()** validates one completed native **libpkgapply**
operation against the exact operation-specific request, accepted plan, target
context, lease-bound state projection, expected native snapshot, ownership
universe, and completed path consequences. It returns an immutable
**state_publication_request** and performs no store I/O.

Additive overloads accept one exact **transaction_evidence_identity**. When
supplied, transaction evidence is retained by the publication request and, for
installation or upgrade, by the durable installation receipt. The same
evidence is supplied to both objects during construction; it is never attached
after projection.

# LEASE-BOUND STATE READ

**read_application_state()** accepts one exact **package_application_request**, one
caller-owned **target_mutation_lease**, and one **canonical_store**. It first proves
that the lease is live and belongs to the request target and exclusion domain,
then performs exactly one canonical store read. The returned
**lease_bound_application_state** owns both the storage-derived **snapshot** and
the matching **lease_bound_state_projection** so they cannot be paired with
different state epochs.

The projection contains the accepted plan's exact path universe and the current
installed owners derived from the canonical snapshot. It is complete only when
the snapshot identity, ownership inventory, target binding, and every path-owner
set agree with the accepted plan. Projection evidence is derived canonically
from the request, target, lease acquisition, target binding, state epoch,
ownership inventory, and path-owner closure. A caller does not supply that
evidence identity.

The lease is checked before and after the state read and again before return. A
lost or foreign lease is a typed projection refusal. Store read failures retain
their native **store_error** classification. The function does not acquire a
lease, initialize a store, inspect the target filesystem, perform application,
publish state, reconcile, or repair.

# INCOMING AUTHORITY

Installation and upgrade requests retain an **incoming_package_authority** that
contains one complete **libpkgbuild-plan** projection. That projection retains the
exact **libpkgbuild-image** admission together with source-derived candidate and
artifact facts established before mutation.

The adapter passes the retained build-image authority directly through
**libpkgstate-build**. That boundary derives the state source record and build
provenance from the exact sealed source, resolver-backed request, successful
build result, and independently inspected image. It accepts no separate
caller-supplied source, build result, image, or provenance value and never
reconstructs build provenance from planner facts.

Installation additionally takes one typed initial installation reason. Upgrade
preserves the prior installed reason. Removal accepts no incoming package or
installation reason.

# OWNERSHIP

Complete object metadata comes from completed application evidence. Active
origin comes from the accepted active outcome. Rejected-object identity and
side come from durable completed rejected-object evidence. Publication fails
when an owned path lacks complete publication-eligible object truth or when
application evidence grants unplanned ownership.

# IDENTITY

Planner and application identities are translated into typed state references.
State-owned installed control, receipt, package, snapshot, request, and
publication identities are computed by **libpkgstate**.

The overloads without transaction evidence remain authoritative for operations
outside an effectful transaction session and preserve their existing identity
semantics.
